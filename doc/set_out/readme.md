This folder contains documents that provide "getting started" instructions for using the IoT device SDKs to create QIoT device client applications to run on various platforms and operating systems.

Each document describes:

- How to obtain the source code for build a simple client application for the platform that uses one of the QIoT device SDKs to facilitate communication with QNAP QIoT container.
- How to configure QNAP QIoT container to receive messages from the sample application.
- How to run the sample application on the device.
- How to verify that the device is communicating with QNAP QIoT container.

For a list of the currently certified devices, see [OS Platforms and hardware compatibility with device SDKs][lnk-compatibilty]
